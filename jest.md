The basic idea behind implementing React testing on your application is to ensure it works as intended. However, the broader idea behind conducting tests on your React application is to make it less prone to errors and deliver a good user experience. Furthermore, applications are typically updated frequently; testing ensures the application doesn’t break and the code is still reliable. 

# Types of React Tests
Whenever you’re set to perform React testing, it becomes difficult to deal with the prospect and often left puzzled, but it doesn’t have to be when you have the right tests in your kit. Knowing the different types of tests unlocks the power of testing and helps you deliver better code to ensure your application is reliable, functional, and efficient. 

Three types of tests can be written for React applications: 

1. Unit tests: These types of tests are performed to test the functionality of an individual component in isolation.

2. Integration tests: These tests ensure the proper functioning of different components working together. It tests the interaction between the parent and child components or when the components contain some dependencies.

3. E2E tests: These tests ensure a proper user experience is received from the user perspective by testing an entire application. 



Unit testing is a critical part of building successful software applications. 
Unit testing is an essential part of any software development process. It allows developers to test individual components of the application and catch any bugs before they make it into production. React.js, being one of the most popular front-end frameworks, has a lot of resources available for unit testing.

# Why Unit Test React.js Applications?
Unit testing allows developers to ensure that each component of the application is working as intended. React.js components can have many different states and behaviors, and it’s important to test all of them to avoid any potential issues. Unit testing also helps catch bugs early in the development process, making it easier to fix them before they make it into production.


# Writing Unit Tests for React Components
Unit tests if performed to test an individual component in isolation. The idea behind implementing unit tests for React components is to ensure each component works as intended regarding its design specifications. 

The anatomy of unit tests follows the AAA approach, which stands for: 

1. Arrange: In this section, as the name suggests, prepare the system for testing. It involves configuring the necessary dependencies and creating required objects. 

2. Act: In this section, you operate on the system that is under test. It may involve calling a function.

3. Assert: In this part, we ensure the outcome matches the expected result. It involves making assertions on the system’s behavior that is under test to ensure its outcome. 


Why is React Unit Testing Important?
1. Reduced Development Time
2. Improved Code Quality
3. Better Documentation
4. Higher Reliability & Maintainability


Best Practices for React.js Unit Testing
1. Test Only One Thing at a Time
By testing one thing at a time, you can isolate issues and ensure that your tests are specific and focused. This can make it easier to debug and fix any issues that arise.
2. Use Mocks and Stubs
React.js applications often have many dependencies, such as APIs, databases, and external libraries. To avoid testing these dependencies, it’s best to use mocks and stubs.
3. Write Tests Before Code
Another best practice for React.js unit testing is to write tests before code. This approach is known as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and can lead to more reliable and predictable code.
4. Use a Testing Framework

React.js has many testing frameworks available, such as Jest, React Testing Library (RTL), and Enzyme. These frameworks provide an easy way to write and run tests, as well as generate reports on the results.


Tools for React.js Unit Testing
1. Jest

Jest is a popular testing framework for React.js applications. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for writing and running tests. Jest also has built-in mocking capabilities, making it easy to test components without worrying about dependencies.


2. React Testing Library

React Testing Library is another popular testing library for React.js applications. It focuses on testing components as users would interact with them, rather than their implementation details.


3. Enzyme

Enzyme is a testing utility for React.js that allows developers to test components’ output and behavior. It provides a simple API for rendering components and inspecting their output. Enzyme is also compatible with many different testing frameworks.

4. Cypress
Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework based on Node.Js that supports JavaScript/TypeScript as the programming language. Cypress is popular for its ease while performing web application testing. 

5. Chai
Chai is a versatile assertion library that can be used in conjunction with Jest or other testing frameworks. Here’s what it brings to the table:

6. Jasmine
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework that emphasizes clear and readable test descriptions. Here are some of the key aspects that make it suitable for React testing:

7. Karma
Karma is a test runner that can be used with various testing frameworks like Mocha or Jasmine. Here are some of the key features that make it beneficial for React testing:

8.  Mocha
Mocha is another popular JavaScript testing framework known for its flexibility and modular design. Here are some of its strengths that make it suitable for React testing:

What is Jest?
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework created by Facebook. It performs unit and integration tests on applications written in any language that transpiles to JavaScript, including React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, and more. Jest provides a powerful assertion library with built-in code coverage reports and other features that make it easy to start writing tests for your application.
Jest was created in 2011 by Facebook and has now become the de facto standard for writing unit tests with React due to its powerful assertion library, comprehensive mocking capabilities, and easy setup process, among other features. 

How Is a Test Structured?
Testing involves checking if your code is functioning as it's supposed to by comparing the expected output with the actual output.

What to Test
In general, your tests should cover the following aspects of your code:

If a component renders with or without props

How a component renders with state changes

How a component reacts to user interactions


What Not to Test
Testing most of your code is important, but here are some things you do not need to test:

Actual Implementation: You do not need to test the actual implementation of a functionality. Just test if the component is behaving correctly.
Let’s say you want to sort an array on the click of a button. There’s no need to test the actual sorting logic. You only test if the function was called and if the state changes are rendering correctly.

Third Party libraries: If you are using any third party libraries like Material UI, no need to test those – they should already be tried and tested.


Any test in React, no matter how complicated, follows this structure:
1. Render the component
2. Get an element from the component and simulate any user interactions
3. Write an assertion.



How to Set Up Our Project

First, create the app with create-react-app. We’ll be using Jest and React Testing Library. Both of them come pre - installed with create-react-app. You can see what it looks like here:

"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
},


As you can see, Jest is not visible here. But, if you go to the node_modules folder, you will see Jest there. So, no need to install it separately.

Also, make sure you have the following lines in your setupTests.js file:

import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';

Also, in your package.json file, modify your scripts like this:

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --watchAll --coverage",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},



How Can We Implement Unit Tests in React?

Prerequisites
Node.js:
A Code Editor:
Jest: A JavaScript testing framework that works well with React.
React Testing Library: It provides utilities for testing React components.



React Testing Library (RTL) with Jest, because the combination of RTL and Jest provides a powerful testing experience for React applications that is easy to set up, maintain, and extend.



Installing and Creating a New React App

npm install create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start



# Installing Jest Using Terminal
npm install --save-dev jest

Installing React Testing Library Using Terminal
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react


add a script in the package.json file


Once Jest is installed, we can create a test file in our React application. Jest will automatically pick up files that end with `.test.js` or `.spec.js` in the project directory.



Writing a Unit Test Case

## Single Element	
#  Type of Query	0 Matches   1 Match    > 1 Matches  Retry (Async/Await)
1. getBy...    Throw error     Return element  Throw error  No
2. queryBy... Return null	Return element	Throw error	No
3. findBy...  Throw error	Return element	Throw error	Yes


## Multiple Elements	
#  Type of Query	0 Matches   1 Match    > 1 Matches  Retry (Async/Await)
1. getAllBy... Throw error	Return array	Return array	No
2. queryAllBy... Return []	Return array	Return array	No
3. findAllBy... Throw error	Return array	Return array	Yes


# SUMMARY:
1. You are to use getBy, findBy, or queryBy when selecting a single DOM element.
2. You are to use getAllBy, findAllBy, or queryAllBy when selecting multiple DOM elements.
3. When there is more than one or no match, the getBy and findBy queries return an Error.
4. When there is no match, then a null value is returned else if there is more than one match, an error is returned by queryBy
5. getBy and queryBy do not work well with asynchronous code, whereas findBy does.
6. If there is any match, then an array of matches is returned else, an error is given by the getAllBy query.
7. If there is any match, then an array of matches is returned else, an error is given by the findAllBy query.
8. If there is any match, then an array of matches is returned else, an empty array is returned by the getAllBy query.



# MyComponent.jsx
<script>
export default function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, World</div>;
}
</script>

# App.jsx
<script>
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

function App() {
return (
  <div className="App">
    <header className="App-header">
      <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
      <p>
        React App Demo.
      </p>
      <MyComponent />
    </header>
  </div>
);
}

export default App;
</script>


# MyComponent.test.js
<script>
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
    const linkElement = getByText(/Hello World/i);
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
</script>
-----------------------OR-----------------------
<script>
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('MyComponent', () => {
 render(<MyComponent/>)
  const element = getByText(/Hello World/i);
  expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
});
</script>

In the example shown, we import the render feature from @testing-library/react for use in a test environment.
We then bring our MyComponent into scope and apply the render function to it. Finally, with getByText, we can retrieve “Hello World” text and check its presence using expect().

npm test

If you change the contents of the div and run the test command. The output in the terminal will be:



# Describe
The describe function is used to group our tests, and its function defines a specific test. The expect function is used to make assertions about the output of our code.



# Testing Props And State
In React, components can have both props and state. It is essential to test that these values are being set and updated correctly.

<script>
// MyComponent.test.js

import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
    const linkElement = getByText(/Hello World/i);
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('renders the correct name prop', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent name="Alice" />);
    const linkElement = getByText(/Hello Alice/i);
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
</script>

we are testing that the component renders the correct name prop. We pass the prop to the component when we render it using the render method. We then use the getByText method to retrieve the “Hello Baires” text and check that it is in the document using the expect method.

The testing state is similar to testing props. We can use the fireEvent method from @testing-library/react to simulate user interactions with the component:


<script>
// MyComponent.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
    const linkElement = getByText(/Hello World/i);
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('renders the correct name prop', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent name="Alice" />);
    const linkElement = getByText(/Hello Baires/i);
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('updates the count state on button click', () => {
    const { getByText, getByTestId } = render(<MyComponent />);
    const countElement = getByTestId('count');
    const buttonElement = getByText(/Click me/i);

    expect(countElement).toHaveTextContent('0');
    fireEvent.click(buttonElement);
    expect(countElement).toHaveTextContent('1');
  });
});
</script>

we are testing that the count state updates when the user clicks the “Click me” button. We use the getByTestId method to retrieve the count element and the getByText method to retrieve the button element.

We then use the expect method to check that the count element initially has a value of 0, simulate a click event using the fireEvent method, and check that the count element has a value of 1.



# Why Is Jest a Great Choice for Unit Testing In React?

Framework	Testing Type	Language	DOM Testing	Code Coverage	Snapshot Testing	Active Community
Jest	Unit	JavaScript	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
Mocha	Unit and Integration	JavaScript	No	Yes	No	Yes
Jasmine	Unit	JavaScript	No	Yes	No	Yes



In a nutshell, Jest is a highly popular testing framework for React that provides out-of-the-box support for snapshot testing, code coverage reporting, and DOM testing. Mocha and Jasmine are also popular testing frameworks for JavaScript, but they lack some of the features and support that Jest provides for React. All three frameworks have active communities and are suitable for testing React applications.



# Built-in Mocking

Jest makes isolating and testing components easy by providing built-in mocking capabilities. You can use Jest’s jest.mock() function to create mock implementations of dependencies that your components rely on, making it possible to test your components without worrying about their dependencies’ behavior.

For example, let’s say you have a component called MyComponent that relies on an external API function called getData(). To mock this API call in Jest, you can create a file called __mocks__/myApi.js with the following code:

export const getData = jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve('mocked data'));


Then, in your test file, you can use jest.mock() to replace the real myApi module with your mock implementation:


import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { getData } from 'myApi';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

jest.mock('myApi');

test('renders data from API', async () => {
  getData.mockResolvedValue('mocked data');

  render(<MyComponent />);

  const data = await screen.findByText('mocked data');
  expect(data).toBeInTheDocument();
});



# Snapshot Testing
Snapshot testing with Jest allows you to capture the output of a component and compare it to a saved version of the same output. This helps detect any unintended changes made to the component’s output. To create a snapshot test for a component in Jest, you can add code in your test file that renders the component using dynamic data from props and saves its output as a snapshot.

To create a snapshot test for the MyComponent component in Jest, you can add the following code to your test file which will capture how it renders with dynamic data from its prop called data.

<script>
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent data="test data" />).toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
</script>


This will create a snapshot of the component’s output when it’s rendered with the prop data=”test data”. If you make any changes to the component’s output, Jest will notify you that the snapshot no longer matches, allowing you to investigate the changes and decide whether to update the snapshot or fix the code.


# Fast and Parallelized Testing

Jest has been designed to optimize speed, allowing tests to be run in parallel so that large projects with numerous tests do not suffer from slow testing times and impede development progress.

Using Jest, you can run all tests for your React app in parallel by executing the following command in your terminal.

npm test -- --maxWorkers=4

This will run your tests with up to 4 workers, allowing Jest to execute multiple tests at the same time and speeding up the overall testing process.


# Built-in Code Coverage Reporting
Jest gives you the ability to quickly and easily assess how much of your codebase is covered by tests with its integrated code coverage reporting. These reports show precisely which parts of your code are being tested, so that you can make sure all vital areas have been addressed. By reviewing these reports, you can determine where additional testing may be needed to ensure a robust and complete test suite.

npm test -- --coverage


This will run your tests and generate a code coverage report in the coverage directory. You can open the index.html file in your web browser to view the code coverage report.


React Testing Components with Jest
Jest is a popular testing framework for React that is simple and powerful enough to write and execute unit tests in React. Jest offers a variety of features for testing React components, such as mocking, snapshot testing, and more.

Now, let’s perform testing of React Components with the help of Jest. In this example, we shall test the ‘HelloWorld’ component which contains the text ‘helloworld’.

Step 1: Install Jest

npm install --save-dev jest
Step 2: Write a Test

Create a .test.js file and paste the following test script inside the file. Write the test with the ‘it’ or ‘test’ function offered by the Jest library. 

import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';

test('renders a message', () => {
const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent message="Hello, World!" />);
const messageElement = getByText(/Hello, World!/i);
expect(messageElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Step 3: Execute the Test

To execute the test, run the following command in the terminal. In this test case, we tested if our application contains the ‘helloworld’ text. 

npx jest HelloWorld.test.js


Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing is generally performed for the testing purposes of the user interface. While running the Snapshot test, Jest creates a series of components compared with the previously saved snapshot. If the snapshot matches the previous one, the test passes otherwise, the test fails. 

First Install the latest version of React test renderer with the following command:

npm install react-test-renderer
Let’s write a Snapshot test for the previous test. 

import React from 'react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';

test('renders correctly', () => {
const component = renderer.create(<HelloWorld />);
const tree = component.toJSON();
expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});


Mocking Dependencies 

Mocking dependencies is the procedure followed to ensure the system under test is isolated from external dependencies or interaction with other modules by replacing the module’s implementation or a function with the mock implementation we define. 

Let’s consider a practical example of how to mock dependencies in Jest. 

const fetchUser = async (userId) => { 
const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`); const data = await response.json(); 
return data; };

const fetch = require('node-fetch');

jest.mock('node-fetch');

describe('fetchUser', () => {

it('returns the user data', async () => {

const mockResponse = { name: 'example' };

fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({

json: jest.fn().mockResolvedValueOnce(mockResponse),

});

const result = await fetchUser(123);

expect(fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

expect(fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('https://api.example.com/users/example');

expect(result).toEqual(mockResponse); 
});

});



Best Practices for Writing Unit Tests
Let’s discuss some of the Unit Testing best practices that must follow to ensure higher reliability, functionality, and efficiency of your unit tests. 

Unit tests are conducted solely to test the individual component without the interference of any other component. Therefore, each component that you put under unit tests must be independent and not rely on any other component or have any dependency. 
To keep the unit test focussed, you must test one thing at a time and should test a specific behavior of a component.
You must invest some time in writing the test names to identify and fix issues if the test fails. You should use descriptive names that specify what you’re testing in a component and what should be the expected outcome. 
Make use of CI/CD pipelines to automate your tests, ensuring the software is always working.
Writing Integration Tests for React Components
In integration testing, the aim is to verify that different system components can work together correctly. To put it another way, an integration test is performed to evaluate how well various components interact. 

The anatomy of an integration test involves four parts, setup, test, assertion, and teardown. 

Setup: In this part, we set up the environment for the system that is to be tested. This may involve configuring dependencies, components, and load data to ensure they are ready for smooth testing. 
Test: This is the part where the integration test is performed. This may include calling out multiple functions in a test file to verify the behavior of components working in combination. 
Assertion: We ensure the outcome matches the expected result in this part. It involves making assertions on the system’s behavior under different conditions to ensure the expected outcome.
Teardown: In this part, we eliminate the resources used solely for testing purposes. It may involve deleting temporary data or shutting down the unnecessary components required during the testing. 

# How to Write Your First Test for a React App

Let’s write a test for the following component:

const FirstTest = () => {
  return (
    <div>
        <h2> First test </h2>
    </div>
  )
}   

we just need to test if the h2 element renders. Now, where should we write the tests? We can write them inside a __tests__ folder anywhere in the src folder. The test file just needs to have a .test.js/jsx extension and the test runner will pick it up.


FirstTest.test.jsx file:

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import FirstTest from '../components/FirstTest';

test("Example 1 renders successfully", () => {
    render(<FirstTest/>);

    const element = screen.getByText(/first test/i);

    expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
})


How to Test With Mock Data in React

import React from 'react'

const TestWithMockData = ({data}) => {
  return (
    <div>
        <ul>
            {data.map(item => (
                <li key={item.id}>
                    {item.id}
                    {item.first_name},
                    {item.last_name},
                    {item.email}

                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default TestWithMockData

const mockData = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "Fletcher",
        "last_name": "McVanamy",
        "email": "mmcvanamy0@e-recht24.de",
        "age": 30
      }, {
        "id": 2,
        "first_name": "Clarice",
        "last_name": "Harrild",
        "email": "charrild1@dion.ne.jp",
        "age": 35
      }, 
]


test("List renders successfully", () => {
    render(<TestWithMockData data={mockData} />)
    expect(screen.getByText(/fletcher/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
})


How to Test User Interactions in React

npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event

<a onClick={() => {
    console.log("email link clicked")
    handleClick()
}}>{item.email}</a>


test("Email link click handler called", async () => {
    const mockHandleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<TestWithMockData 
                data={mockData} 
                displayUnorderedList={true}
                handleClick = {mockHandleClick}
          />)
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/mmcvanamy0@e-recht24.de/i));
    expect(mockHandleClick).toHaveBeenCalled();
})


How to Query Input Fields and Buttons

<input placeholder='Enter name'/>
<button> Submit </button>
const inputElement = screen.getByRole('textbox')
const button = screen.getByRole('button')

const nameInput = screen.getByPlaceholderText(/enter name/i);
const descrInput = screen.getByPlaceholderText(/enter description/i);

<label htmlFor='password'> Enter password</label>
<input type='password' id='password'/>
const passwordInput = screen.getByLabelText(/enter password/i);
<button> Submit </button>
<button> Apply</button>

const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i });
const applyButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /apply/i });

const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);


How to Test State Updates in React


const TestingStateChange = () => {
    const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false)
    useEffect(() => {
        setLoaded(true)
    }, [])
  return (
    <div>
        {loaded && <h3> Page Loaded </h3>}
    </div>
  )
}


test("Testing page load", () => {
    render(<TestingStateChange/>)
    expect(screen.getByText(/page loaded/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
})


How to Test a State Change on Click of a Button

const [toggleTextVisible, setToggleTextVisible] = useState(false)`


{toggleTextVisible && <p> Text visible </p> }

<button onClick={() => { setToggleTextVisible(!toggleTextVisible) }}> 
    Toggle text 
</button>


test("Toggle text visible", async () => {
    render(<TestingStateChange/>);
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/toggle text/i));
    expect(screen.getByText(/text visible/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
})


const [btnDisabled, setBtnDisabled] = useState(false);
<button onClick={() => { setBtnDisabled(!btnDisabled) }}> 
      Toggle button disabled 
</button>

test("Button disabled on click", async () => {
    render(<TestingStateChange/>)
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/toggle button disabled/i));
    expect(screen.getByText(/toggle text/i)).toBeDisabled();
})



How to Test if an Element Was Added to a List
const [elements, setElements] = useState(data);

<h3> List </h3>
{elements.map(item => (
    <div key= {item.id}>
       {item.id}: { item.name }
    </div>
))}
<button onClick={() => {
    setElements([...elements, {
        id: 4,
        name: 'abhinav'
    }])
}}> Add to list </button>


test("Element added to the list", async () => {
    render(<TestingStateChange/>)
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('record').length).toBe(3);

    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/add to list/i));
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('record').length).toBe(4);
})


expect(screen.getByText(/abhinav/i)).toBeInTheDocument();



How to Test if an Element Was Removed From a List

<button onClick={() => {
    setElements(elements.filter(item => item.id != 2))
}}> Remove from list </button>

test("Element removed from list", async () => {
    render(<TestingStateChange/>)
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/remove from list/i));
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('record').length).toBe(2);
})



How to Test API Calls in React



We put the method in a separate Services.js file and export it from there.

export const FetchData = () => {
    return fetch("http://localhost:3000/data.json")
        .then(res => {
            return res.json();
        }) 
}


const [data, setData] = useState([])

useEffect(() => {
    FetchData().then(data => {
        setData(data);
    })
})

Conclusion
Test driven development(tdd) with Jest in React is a powerful tool to help both React development companies and individual developers create reliable, bug-free applications. With its easy configuration, intuitive interfaces and comprehensive coverage of the React library, it’s no wonder why so many developers are choosing to use Jest for their unit testing.

Not only does it provide an efficient way to ensure that code performs as expected but also helps find any issues quickly and accurately. The combination of Jest and React allows developers to produce robust applications that can be confidently deployed into production environments. With all these benefits, there’s no reason not to consider unit testing with Jest in React for your next project!

Which Library Is Used for Unit Testing in React?
Jest is a popular library used for unit testing in React.

Why Is Jest So Popular?
Jest is popular because it is easy to set up and use, has a simple and intuitive syntax, and provides a range of features and tools for testing React applications.

Is Jest Good for React Unit Testing?
Yes, Jest is a good choice for unit testing in React. It is designed specifically for testing JavaScript applications and provides a range of features and tools for testing React components, including support for snapshot testing, mocking, and code coverage analysis. It is also widely used and well-supported by the React community.



Recommended Tools
Jest is a JavaScript test runner that lets you access the DOM via jsdom. While jsdom is only an approximation of how the browser works, it is often good enough for testing React components. Jest provides a great iteration speed combined with powerful features like mocking modules and timers so you can have more control over how the code executes.

React Testing Library is a set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details. This approach makes refactoring a breeze and also nudges you towards best practices for accessibility. Although it doesn’t provide a way to “shallowly” render a component without its children, a test runner like Jest lets you do this by mocking.

Writing End-to-End Tests for React Components
End-to-end testing, often known as E2E testing, involves testing an application’s complete lifecycle, including all of its levels and components. In E2E testing we expect the software to work as intended while putting it under real-world scenarios. 

The anatomy of E2E testing for React components includes:

Identifying test scenarios: In this step, test scenarios are identified based on the application’s requirements. 
Set up the test environment: The testing environment should be similar to the production environment, to replicate the real-world scenarios as closely as possible. It involves having the same configurations on the testing and production end. 
Write test scripts: Various testing frameworks are available to run automated test scripts simulating real user interactions with the application. 
Execute the test scripts: Automated test scripts must be executed in a suitable testing environment to ensure higher reliability of tests. 
Analyze the test results: This part involves generating reports on how to test went to identify various issues and defects in the application. 



Best Practices for Writing Integration Tests
Let’s discuss some of the best practices that must follow to ensure higher reliability, functionality, and efficiency of your integration tests. 

Integration tests can be very time-consuming, therefore, it is a good practice to automate the testing process to save time and prevent any slight human error. 
You must fabricate proper documentation of your Integration tests to ensure they are repeatable and easy to grasp. Documentation is also a necessary aspect as it helps gradually upgrade the overall quality of tests. 
The entire idea behind implementing Integration tests is to ensure the proper functioning of interaction among different components. Therefore, you must test the system as a whole.
Try to incorporate data that reflects upon real-world scenarios for finding out the product’s best and worst use cases.


Best Practices for Writing Unit Tests
Let’s discuss some of the Unit Testing best practices that must follow to ensure higher reliability, functionality, and efficiency of your unit tests. 

Unit tests are conducted solely to test the individual component without the interference of any other component. Therefore, each component that you put under unit tests must be independent and not rely on any other component or have any dependency. 
To keep the unit test focussed, you must test one thing at a time and should test a specific behavior of a component.
You must invest some time in writing the test names to identify and fix issues if the test fails. You should use descriptive names that specify what you’re testing in a component and what should be the expected outcome. 
Make use of CI/CD pipelines to automate your tests, ensuring the software is always working.


Why use Jest Framework For Selenium JavaScript Testing?
Speed and Performance – Jest framework is fast when executing test cases
Pre-commit hooks – Jest framework offers pre-commit hooks that complete sets of test cases that are significant in the current run or ones that have been changed after the previous commit
Easy to Migrate – Thanks to the code mods module, any current test project can be migrated and switched to use the Jest framework programmatically without issues or code interaction.
Addition of Features and Configurations – The framework is an ordinary and essential test runner and offers some advanced features. These include the ability to mock auto modules, set up coverage thresholds, and module mappers. It also supports multiple projects in the same runner and customer resolvers such as Babel and Webpack.
