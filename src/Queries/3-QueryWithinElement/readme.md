This is used when we have to test parent with their child.

In React Testing Library (RTL), within is a function that allows you to limit the scope of your queries to a specific part of the DOM. This is useful when you're targeting elements that are nested within a specific container or component, ensuring you're querying the right part of the DOM.

Why Use within?
Scoped queries: When multiple elements match a query across the whole page, and you want to narrow your search to a specific container.
Testing components in isolation: Helps ensure that you're only interacting with the intended part of the DOM.
Improved accuracy: Avoids false positives when multiple elements have similar attributes.
How to Use within
within allows you to perform all of the standard queries (getBy, findBy, queryBy, etc.) within a specific DOM node or container.

Example
Consider a scenario where you have multiple sections with the same structure, but you want to test only the content within a specific section.


<div>
  <section aria-label="Section 1">
    <button>Click me</button>
  </section>
  <section aria-label="Section 2">
    <button>Click me</button>
  </section>
</div>
Test Using within:
In this example, you're narrowing the scope of the query to a specific section.


import { render, screen, within } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // Assume this component renders the above HTML

test('finds button within a specific section', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);

  // First, find the section by its label
  const section = screen.getByLabelText('Section 1');

  // Use 'within' to limit the search to the button inside that section
  const button = within(section).getByText('Click me');

  expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Breakdown:
screen.getByLabelText('Section 1'): This finds the section based on its ARIA label.
within(section).getByText('Click me'): This restricts the search for the button to within the section we found.
Other Examples:
Querying Elements within a Table Row:
You may want to target elements inside a specific table row.


test('finds the element within a specific row', () => {
  render(<TableComponent />);

  const row = screen.getByRole('row', { name: /John Doe/i });
  const withinRow = within(row);
  const cell = withinRow.getByText('john.doe@example.com');

  expect(cell).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Querying within a Modal:
For components like modals or dialogs, you can limit your queries to the modal content only.


test('checks the content inside the modal', () => {
  render(<App />);

  const modal = screen.getByRole('dialog');
  const withinModal = within(modal);
  const closeButton = withinModal.getByRole('button', { name: /close/i });

  expect(closeButton).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Summary of within:
within(container) limits all queries to the specific container.
It helps ensure targeted querying when multiple elements have similar attributes across different sections of the DOM.
You can use any RTL query (getBy*, queryBy*, findBy*) inside the within function to scope your search.
By using within, you can improve the accuracy of your tests and make them more reliable when dealing with nested or repeated elements.
