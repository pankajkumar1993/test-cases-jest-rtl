Emmet: Include Languages
Enable Emmet abbreviations in languages that are not supported by default. Add a mapping here between the language and Emmet supported language. For example: {"vue-html": "html", "javascript": "javascriptreact"}

Files: Associations
Configure glob patterns of file associations to languages (for example "*.extension": "html"). Patterns will match on the absolute path of a file if they contain a path separator and will match on the name of the file otherwise. These have precedence over the default associations of the languages installed.
